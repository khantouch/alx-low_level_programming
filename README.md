The task of writing a script to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file is a relatively straightforward one. 
The first step is to create a script that will take the C file as an input and then run it through the preprocessor. 
This can be done using the C preprocessor command line utility, which is typically included with most C compilers. 
The command line utility takes the C file as an argument and then runs it through the preprocessor, producing the preprocessed output. 

Once the preprocessed output is generated, the script should then save the output into a separate file. 
This can be done using the standard file I/O functions available in most programming languages. 
The script should open the output file for writing, and then write the preprocessed output to the file. 
Once the output is written, the script should then close the file. 

Finally, the script should also provide some feedback to the user, such as a message indicating that the preprocessing was successful. 
This can be done using the standard output functions available in most programming languages. 

In summary, the task of writing a script to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file is a relatively straightforward one. 
The script should take the C file as an input, run it through the preprocessor, save the output into a separate file, and then provide some feedback to the user.
